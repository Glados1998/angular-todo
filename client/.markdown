## How it works

the app is composed of 4 components <br>

- app.component - the main component
- todo-item.component - the component that contains the task with the edit and delete button
- todo-form.component - the component that contains the form to add a task
- todo-editor.component - the component that contains the form to edit a task

#### the 3 first components communicate wth the help of @Input and @Output <br>

#### the form components sends a formgroup to the app.component <br> to pushed it to the list of tasks <br> in return the app.component sends the task to the todo-item.component <br> to display it in the list of tasks <br>

#### when we want to edit a task we inject data inside a dialogue field from Angular material when we finish we send the form value back to the todo-item and replace the new value with old one with corresponding index
